To push your changes to GitHub, you need to have a remote repository set up on GitHub. Here are the steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub. You can do this on the GitHub website by clicking the '+' button in the top right corner and selecting 'New repository'. Name your repository and click 'Create repository'.

In your terminal, navigate to your local project directory using the cd command.

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
Add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
Replace remote_repository_URL with the URL of your newly created GitHub repository. It should look something like https://github.com/username/repo.git.

Verify the new remote URL.
Stage the file for commit.
Commit the changes.
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
Replace yourfile.py with the name of your file and "Your commit message" with a meaningful message describing the changes you made. Replace master with the name of your branch if it is different.
