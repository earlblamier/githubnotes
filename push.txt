To push your changes to GitHub, you need to have a remote repository set up on GitHub. Here are the steps:

Create a new repository on GitHub. You can do this on the GitHub website by clicking the '+' button in the top right corner and selecting 'New repository'. Name your repository and click 'Create repository'.

In your terminal, navigate to your local project directory using the cd command.

  cd path/to/your/repository

Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
  git init

Add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
  git remote add origin remote_repository_URL

Replace remote_repository_URL with the URL of your newly created GitHub repository. It should look something like https://github.com/username/repo.git.

Verify the new remote URL.
  git remote -v

Stage the file for commit.
  git add yourfile.py

Commit the changes.
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.
  git push origin master

Replace yourfile.py with the name of your file and "Your commit message" with a meaningful message describing the changes you made. Replace master with the name of your branch if it is different.
